Explorer   While   surfing   the   Web   or   reading   your   email   an   intruder   from   the   Internet   steals   your   data   without   hindrance   A   horror   vision   Microsofts   new   Internet   Explorer   makes   it   a   reality   It   allows   the   hiding   of   commands   in   an   email   or   Web   page   that   secretly   send   files   to   unauthorized   people   Internet   Consultant   who   reviewed   for   the   German   computer   magazine   considers   this   security   hole   a   severe   problem   for   end   users   and   companies   Even   a   corporate   network   secured   by   a   firewall   is   not   protected   against   this   attack   The   security   hole   is   not   an   error   in   the   code   but   has   its   reasons   in   the   concept   of   the   program   he   says   It   even   exists   when   the   browsers   security   options   are   set   to   the   standard   values   for   high   This   way   it   is   possible   to   spy   out   text   and   HTML   files   at   least   there   are   other   types   of   files   affected   is   not   cleared   up   at   the   moment   The   security   hole   exists   in   IE4   for   and   Apparently   the   preview   version   for   the   is   not   affected   The   only   obstacle   for   the   intruder   he   has   to   specify   exact   path   names   or   Intranet   addresses   for   the   files   Since   a   lot   of   programs   e.g.   when   running   with   use   standardized   directory   names   the   thief   has   a   good   chance   to   get   the   security   file   for   a   homebanking   program   for   example   The   trick   is   quite   easy   It   is   based   on   Microsofts   Dynamic   The   intruder   hides   a   so-called   with   a   reference   to   the   wanted   document   in   a   mail   or   Web   page   While   the   unsuspicious   victim   reads   the   browser   or   the   email   client   Outlok   Express   loads   the   referenced   file   into   unvisible   window   An   additional   hidden   IFRAME   then   sends   it   to   the   hackers   server   At   the   moment   the   only   way   to   protect   your   data   is   to   disable   the   setting   Active   Scripting   in   the   basic   options   of   Internet   Explorer   for   all   Internet   zones   You   can   find   it   in   the   menu   View   Internet   options   security   settings   But   then   important   program   functions   are   lost   many   web   offerings   are   not   accessible   anymore   Informed   about   the   test   results   acted   quickly   They   also   accessed   a   German   Web   server   that   was   set   up   especially   to   demonstrate   the   security   hole   A   spokesperson   from   stated   afterwards   that   a   program   to   correct   the   problem   would   presumably   be   put   on   Microsoft's   site   on   regards   the   failure   not   to   be   severe   he   said   It   wouldn't   be   possible   to   change   or   destroy   files   this   way   Detailled   information   about   the   IFRAME   security   hole   and   protection   mechanisms   can   be   read   on   the   server   of   Hueskes   and   also   in   the   upcoming   issue   of   that   will   be   published   on   October   Double   Data   Rate   Dolby   Digital   go   Go   Enterprise   The

 all   employees   at   Our   company   is   always   in   the   focus   of   the   public   spotlight   We   have   seen   this   both   in   the   past   when   the   reasons   were   positive   and   in   the   past   few   months   when   they   have   been   negative   The   main   reason   for   the   increased   level   of   interest   shown   by   the   media   was   and   is   the   far   from   pleasing   development   of   the   share   prices   of   the   T-Share   and   the   share   We   all   know   that   there   are   links   between   published   opinions   and   the   development   of   share   prices   And   as   negative   headlines   tend   to   attract   greater   attention   and   interest   a   company   such   as   ours   which   is   subject   to   such   intense   public   scrutiny   has   to   tackle   not   only   the   challenges   which   currently   face   our   entire   industry   worldwide   with   the   development   of   the   finance   markets   but   also   the   problems   of   public   reporting   The   fact   that   we   have   in   the   past   been   a   positive   object   of   public   interest   is   no   consolation   Nor   is   the   fact   that   other   companies   in   our   industry   more   or   less   share   our   fate   I   regret   very   much   this   fall   in   the   share   price   which   has   hit   our   shareholders   and   therefore   the   majority   of   our   employees   The   negative   developments   in   the   price   of   the   T-Share   in   the   past   few   days   is   not   justified   by   any   facts   relating   to   the   company   The   valuation   of   the   T-Share   is   currently   at   a   level   which   bears   no   relation   to   the   value   of   the   company   its   prospects   for   development   or   its   current   position   in   competition   The   development   of   the   share   price   in   the   past   few   days   in   particular   cannot   be   explained   by   facts   relating   to   the   company   The   positive   voices   of   which   there   are   in   reality   a   great   many   are   almost   completely   drowned   out   in   the   multi-layered   variety   of   opinions   We   will   communicate   our   strengths   emphatically   We   will   therefore   communicate   our   strategy   and   our   strengths   more   intensively   in   dialogue   with   the   public   and   the   financial   community   and   use   professional   share   marketing   More   information   about   this   is   available   on   the   intranet   homepage   http://intranet.telekom.de   Let   me   now   respond   briefly   to   the   negative   headlines   which   are   repeatedly   directed   at   us   in   the   media   Experts   confirm   The   decision   to   acquire   was   right   I   shall   start   with   the   final   point   The   opportunities   on   the   so   far   relatively   underdeveloped   U.S.   mobile   communications   market   are   enormous   And   practically   nobody   in   the   market   now   seriously   questions   our   concept   of   creating   the   first   transatlantic   and   world   's   largest   provider   on   the   basis   of   technology   Of   course   there   is   still   great   deal   to   do   in   the   once   we   receive   approval   of   the   acquisition   But   the   growth   of   %   in   VoiceStream's   revenue   and   the   %   increase   in   the   number   of   customers   in   the   past   financial   year   speak   for   themselves   So   does   the   intention   of   competitors   now   to   follow   suit   in   setting   up   networks   albeit   with   a   considerable   delay   Our   investments   in   the   future   have   a   sound   financial   basis   for   the   level   of   debt   It   is   a   fact   that   we   are   considerably   better   financed   than   some   of   our   large   international   competitors   We   will   as   planned   use   the   proceeds   from   the   sale   of   activities   which   no   longer   form   part   of   our   core   activities   We   already   received   considerable   sums   last   year   as   proceeds   from   such   sales   In   addition   we   expanded   and   safeguarded   our   financial   basis   with   a   global   bond   much   sooner   and   therefore   under   far   more   favourable   conditions   than   our   competitors   which   means   that   we   are   in   no   way   under   the   same   pressure   as   other   companies   in   the   industry   To   put   it   briefly   Our   investments   in   the   future   have   cost   a   lot   of   money   we   have   invested   or   planned   a   total   of   approximately   billion   euros   in   the   last   two   years   including   the   planned   acquisition   of   But   we   have   made   these   investments   with   specific   focus   never   hastily   and   always   with   an   eye   on   our   financial   capabilities   and   within   our   strategy   of   increasing   the   shareholder   value   of   the   company   in   the   long   term   Our   plans   for   the   future   have   a   sound   foundation   and   are   not   to   be   shaken   not   even   in   individual   areas   Hardly   anyone   is   as   well   positioned   we   are   to   generate   revenues   and   profits   from   so   quickly   And   now   to   Of   course   the   licences   were   very   expensive   But   with   all   other   investments   we   did   analyse   the   economic   viability   very   carefully   and   come   to   a   positive   conclusion   The   decisive   factor   is   what   opportunities   one   has   to   generate   revenues   and   profits   from   faster   and   to   a   greater   extent   than   one   's   competitors   And   hardly   anyone   is   as   well   prepared   we   are   in   this   respect   Not   least   because   we   are   the   clear   number   among   business   customers   who   are   typically   the   first   to   take   up   new   technologies   Only   recently   the   business   magazine   reported   on   a   survey   which   found   that   accounts   for   per   cent   of   all   investment   companies   in   are   planning   to   make   in   mobile   communications   by   the   middle   of   this   year   companies   in   And   besides   wherever   we   have   acquired   UMTS   licences   we   have   a   very   strong   customer   base   in   contrast   to   some   of   our   competitors   who   have   to   start   practically   from   zero   winning   customers   over   in   an   intense   competitive   environment   with   relatively   saturated   markets   Our   strategy   In   contrast   to   other   companies   we   have   already   laid   our   foundation   Finally   to   the   matter   of   corporate   strategy   Our   pillar   growth   strategy   puts   us   in   a   better   position   to   tackle   the   challenge   of   the   rapidly   changing   markets   than   any   of   our   competitors   This   is   particularly   true   of   the   dominant   technological   development   of   the   21st   century   namely   the   fusion   of   telecommunications   and   information   technology   to   create   telematics   While   some   are   even   now   still   talking   about   it   we   laid   our   foundations   long   ago   and   are   already   working   dedicatedly   on   furthering   this   strategy   Let   us   take   the   example   of   As   a   result   of   our   cooperation   with   Systemhaus   we   became   Europe's   number   in   the   globally   booming   systems   solutions   market   overnight   and   are   just   entering   the   market   with   an   aggressive   communication   campaign   is   our   next   growth   locomotive   to   be   put   on   the   track   and   clear   advantages   in   entering   the   telematics   market   for   which   annual   growth   rates   of   per   cent   to   billion   euros   are   being   predicted   to   the   year   in   alone   In   summary   We   are   in   an   excellent   position   both   financially   and   strategically   All   this   goes   to   show   It   is   a   indisputable   fact   that   we   are   in   an   excellent   position   both   financially   and   strategically   a   position   which   is   the   envy   of   telecommunications   companies   around   the   world   And   it   is   therefore   also   a   fact   that   the   T-Share   is   worth   far   more   than   the   price   at   which   it   is   currently   being   traded   Speculations   of   resignation   completely   unfounded   Of   course   I   bear   the   responsibility   for   the   company   's   strategy   It   is   I   who   must   face   the   criticism   of   this   strategy   I   say   therefore   very   clearly   The   speculation   of   the   past   few   days   concerning   me   is   totally   without   foundation   And   once   more   All   serious   telecommunications   experts   confirm   that   our   strategy   is   the   right   one   And   above   all   that   the   course   we   are   taking   is   not   only   the   right   one   but   also   the   necessary   one.   and   that   we   have   excellent   preconditions   in   comparison   with   other   international   telecommunications   companies   I   continue   to   stand   by   my   responsibility   without   ifs   and   buts   I   owe   it   not   least   to   all   of   you   who   in   your   various   functions   are   driving   the   company   along   its   course   and   are   giving   your   heart   and   your   strength   to   the   job   to   make   this   strategy   a   success   We   have   achieved   a   great   deal   together   in   the   past   years   perhaps   more   than   some   thought   us   capable   of   a   few   years   ago   Let   us   all   therefore   continue   to   work   with   commitment   strength   and   willingness   to   push   our   company   further   ahead   in   competition   We   are   in   an   excellent   starting   position   and   this   will   be   rewarded   by   the   capital   markets   soon   Financial   Times
